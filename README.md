# Game of Life
During Hackathon organized by KNI (Koło Naukowe Informatyków) on Warsaw Uinversity of Technology 
in 2021 I created easy to use, simple implementation of John Conway's Game of Life using C++ and SFML library. 
## Instructions
Application has 2 scenes - **Info Scene** and **Game Scene**. Since there is no UI, Info Scene provides informations
about all of the keybinds which allows you to navigate the program.

Game Scene provides two states (modes) - **Drawing State** and **Simulation State**, you can switch between them using Spacebar. 
In drawing mode one can save the game, load it, change the map size using predefinded sizes and more. Program also allows one simulation step forward option. 
## Executable file
If you are a windows user, you can run the application using built version stored in the "Release" folder. Note that all of the .dll files and presets folder (whole content of "Release" folder) are needed for application to work properly.
